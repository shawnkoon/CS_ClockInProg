  <h1>Program Specification.</h1>
  <p> Before user is able to see the program we need to load the database with all the student numbers
   I think we need to have the admin enter all the student IDs into a text file. Then, have the program read in the 
   file and crate the student objects. which will then be stored in the sql database. 
  </p>
  <p>Or we can have another form just for the <strong>administrator </strong></p>
  <p>Let me know what you think, but we have to have a way for the administrator to enter all the 
  student/faculty id numbers.</p>
  <li>User Starts Program.</li>
  <li>The Clock in Program is ready to use once opend.</li>
  <li>When the Program Exits, it update log file accordingly.</li>
  <li>While the program updates, it deletes the record of ones without log out history</li>
  <li>Admin is able to access student/log database for modifications. (Password Required)</li>
